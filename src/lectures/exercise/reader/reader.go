//--Summary:
//  Create an interactive command line application that supports arbitrary
//  commands. When the user enters a command, the program will respond
//  with a message. The program should keep track of how many commands
//  have been ran, and how many lines of text was entered by the user.
//
//--Requirements:
//* When the user enters either "hello" or "bye", the program
//  should respond with a message after pressing the enter key.
//* Whenever the user types a "Q" or "q", the program should exit.
//* Upon program exit, some usage statistics should be printed
//  ('Q' and 'q' do not count towards these statistics):
//  - The number of non-blank lines entered
//  - The number of commands entered
//
//--Notes
//* Use any Reader implementation from the stdlib to implement the program
