//--Summary:
//  Create a grep clone that can do simple substring searching
//  within files. It must auto-recurse into subdirectories.
//
//--Requirements:
//* Use goroutines to search through the files for a substring match
//* Display matches to the terminal as they are found
//  * Display the line number, file path, and complete line containing the match
//* Recurse into any subdirectories looking for matches
//* Use any synchronization method to ensure that all files
//  are searched, and all results are displayed before the program
//  terminates.
//
//--Notes:
//* Program invocation should follow the pattern:
//    mgrep search_string search_dir
